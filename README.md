# Data Analysis 

1. What were the immunization rates for the year 2000 and 2015? 

A pivot table with *Calculated Fields*  will be used to find the immunization rates. 

To add a *Calculated Field,* all you have to do is click Add

Then at the very top the *Calculated Field* option should pop up.

From there, you can make formulas like the one before in order to get a desired outcome.

Along with this, a filter for the years will need to be used as well.

> This filter and Calculated Fields will be used for future pivot tables as well. 

The Pivot Table should end up like this

The vaccination rates for all three vaccines were higher in 2000 than in 2014. 

2. What were the exemption rates in 2000? 2014? 

A pivot table with *Calculated Fields* will be used once again. 

<img width="292" alt="j124 q2 3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88923290/183421110-1314834f-8331-414f-b81e-fb8d14ca6834.png">

The pivot table should come out looking like this. 

<img width="348" alt="j124 q2 2 " src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88923290/183421231-4d7a9122-4bba-4dee-a434-c391082c220b.png">

The exemption rates were higher in 2014 than in 2000, showing a correlation between higher exemption rates and lower vaccine rates in 2014 and higher vaccination rates and lower exemption rates in 2000. 

3. Which counties had the highest vaccination rates in 2000? 2014? 

The same *Calculated Fields* from q1 will be used for this pivot table, only thing new will be the addition of counties.

In order to find the three counties with the highest vaccination rates, the *Order* needs to be set to *Descending* and *Sort By* will be adjusted for each of the three vaccination rate values.
